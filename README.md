here are the description of README file for my reprository in github, please edit this: Script for analysing data from calcium imaging (+stimulation)
This repository consist of two files that analyze the data yoy got from ImageJ. The design of experiment is to evaluate the effect of stimulationgg(eg. Optogenetic) on the activity of selected region.

## F2P
The F2P script is designed to analyze data obtained from ImageJ. It requires a specific file directory containing three distinctive files:

    ImageJ Output File: A CSV file with headers representing different regions and their activity values at different time steps.

    Frame and E-phys Data: Another CSV file containing frame and electrophysiology data.

    "Online Analysis" Text File: A text file generated by ImageJ to obtain time steps.

The output of this script is a CSV file that provides data from 2 seconds before and after the first stimulus. Additionally, it generates two figures:

    DeltaF/F Plot: Shows the change in fluorescence intensity (deltaF/F) of your regions of interest 2 seconds before and after the stimulus.

    Separated Image Version: An image showing the separated regions of interest based on the analysis.

## F2P_stat Script

The F2P_stat script builds upon the previous analysis and is intended to be used with the data obtained from the F2P script, including experiment and control groups.

This script provides the following analyses:

    ANOVA Table: Conducts an analysis of variance to evaluate statistical differences between different groups (deltaF/F).

    Box Plots: Generates box plots for visual comparison of deltaF/F values between different groups.

    Comparison of DeltaF/F: Compares the average deltaF/F of the control and experiment groups for each region of interest (pre and post stimulation).

    Average DeltaF/F over Time: Plots the average deltaF/F over time for the control and experiment groups of each region.

    Ranksum Test P-Values: Stores the p-values obtained from the ranksum test in a newly created Excel file.

By using these scripts, researchers can efficiently analyze and compare the effects of stimulation on calcium imaging data from different experimental groups.

Please feel free to contribute, report issues, or suggest improvements to this repository. Happy data analysis!
